===============

A robot brain capable of probabilistically mapping out its environment and navigating to a goal. This is the solution of myself and my partner for the last design lab of the 6.01 course at MIT.

Lab Description
===============

> In this lab, we will be looking at the problem of planning in an unknown environment. We will
accomplish this task by building a map of the world as the robot moves around, and by updating
our planned path as we make changes to the map
